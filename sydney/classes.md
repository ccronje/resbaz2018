## Days 1 & 2 Workshops
  ### > Introductory Python
  **Set up instructions:** [https://piccolomud.github.io/2018-07-03-ResBazPythonIntro/](https://piccolomud.github.io/2018-07-03-ResBazPythonIntro/)</br><br/>This beginners' workshop will introduce programming and data analysis with Python. We will cover basic concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data management, and task automation. You will learn to use JupyterLab, Git and Bash Shell. No previous knowledge required.<br/><br/>
  ### > Advanced Python & Data Visualisation
  **Set up instructions:** [https://mq-software-carpentry.github.io/2018-07-03-resbaz-python-advanced/](https://mq-software-carpentry.github.io/2018-07-03-resbaz-python-advanced/)</br><br/>Day one of this workshop covers testing and continuous integration with Python. You will learn how to prevent, diagnose, and fix bugs in Python. We will cover simulations, test suites, and resources available for defensive programming. On day two, there are two options available: Stream A covers data visualisation for the web using D3. You will learn to present your data in an engaging and accessible way. Stream B covers data visualisation with python. You will learn how to use Dataframes in Python using the Pandas library (Data Manipulation) and how to visualise data in Python using the Seaborn and the Matplotlib libraries (Data Visualisation). We teach these researcher-focused training modules using Jupyter notebooks, which allow program code, results, visualisations and documentation to be blended seamlessly.

  ### > Introductory R
  **Set up instructions:** [http://daryavanichkina.com/2018-07-03-ResbazSydney/](http://daryavanichkina.com/2018-07-03-ResbazSydney/)</br><br/>This beginners' workshop teaches data cleaning, management, analysis and visualisation using spreadsheets, OpenRefine and R programming language.  Authentic datasets will be used to demonstrate data management and analysis workflow. No previous knowledge required.<br/><br/>
  ### > Advanced R
  **Set up instructions:** [https://humburg.github.io/2018-07-03-resbaz-sydneyAdvR/](https://humburg.github.io/2018-07-03-resbaz-sydneyAdvR/)</br><br/>This advanced workshop teaches useful programming concepts that will make writing R code more efficient, modular, and reusable, as well as packages for efficient data analysis. You will also learn how to use R to analyse geospatial data, and how to develop Shiny applications that allow users to run their own analyses on your data. Prerequisites: prior experience with R, a GitHub account and GitHub desktop client.<br/><br/>
  ### > SQL & Data Manipulation
  **Set up instructions:** [https://denubis.github.io/2018-07-03-resbaz2018sql/](https://denubis.github.io/2018-07-03-resbaz2018sql/)</br><br/>This intermediate workshop teaches data manipulation using SQL and Python. Day one covers SQL and good database design. Day two teaches webscraping and transitioning from spreadsheets to databases. Prerequisite: prior experience with the bash shell and Python, a GitHub account and GitHub desktop client.<br/><br/>
  ### > Humanities, Arts & Social Sciences (HASS) Mixed Stream
  **Session information:** [http://pad.software-carpentry.org/HASS_Mixed_Stream](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/HASS_Mixed_Stream)</br><br/>This beginners' workshop introduces Alveo, the virtual lab for human communications sciences; Research Data Management; Jupyter notebook; AURIN, the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network; the Australian Data Archive; and Trove, a platform for cultural research in Australia. No previous knowledge required.<br/><br/>
## Day 3 Festival Day
A festival of lightning talks, hands-on activities around particular themes, and for HASS participants, a THATCamp (The Humanities and Technology Camp) Unconference.
